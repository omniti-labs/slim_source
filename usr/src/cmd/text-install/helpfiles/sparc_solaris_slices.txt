SPARC: SOLARIS SLICES

This screen displays the VTOC slices for the SPARC storage device that you selected in the previous screen. The slices are listed in layout order. 

PROCEDURE

To exit this help screen, press F3. Then, in the installer screen, use the arrow keys to highlight either "Use the whole disk" or "Use a slice on the disk." 

     * If you select "Use a slice on the disk," the next screen enables you to select which slice to use for the installation and to make changes to the slice layout.

     * If you select "Use the whole disk," the installer records that choice and proceeds to the next task.

       CAUTION: The "Use the whole disk" selection erases the entire disk during installation. The disk is overwritten with the new OmniOS OS.

Press F2 to continue to the next screen.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to move through the text on each screen.

Note: If your keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
