# Configuration variables for the runtime environment of the nightly
# build script and other tools for construction and packaging of releases.
# This script is sourced by 'nightly' and 'bldenv' to set up the environment
# for the build. This example is suitable for building a developers workspace,
# which will contain the resulting packages and archives. It is based off
# the Install Nevada release. It sets NIGHTLY_OPTIONS to make nightly do:
#	DEBUG and non-DEBUG builds (-D)
#	runs lint in usr/src (-l plus the LINTDIRS variable)
#	sends mail on completion (-m and the MAILTO variable)
#	creates packages for PIT/RE (-p)
#	does not run protocmp (-N); packages are a mess
#
# Options known not to work (yet) in Install are:
#	-C	'make check' cstyle target is not present
#	-S#	no source product
#	-X	no such thing as Install IHV
#	-a	bfu archives not used in Install
#	-r	ELF runtime checking needs some help for ON references
#	-t	tools are not separately packaged yet
#
# Other features disabled:
#	CHECK_PATHS	no packaging exception list
#
